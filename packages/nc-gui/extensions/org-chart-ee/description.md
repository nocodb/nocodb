The org chart app lets you visually represent relationships between similar items, such as company hierarchies or family trees. You can also customize each record's display on the chart by selecting an additional field for more detail.

To set up an org chart, ensure your table includes at least one self-linking field—this means a linked record field that connects records within the same table. Keep in mind that the org chart app only supports records linked within a single table and isn’t designed for cross-table relationships.
