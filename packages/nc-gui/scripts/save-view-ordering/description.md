This script preserves the manual record ordering from a view by saving it to a numeric field in your table. 

### What it does
Captures the current ordering of records in your selected view
Assigns sequential numbers (1, 2, 3...) to a numeric field you specify

### Why it's useful
Preserve manually arranged records for reference
Apply the same ordering to other views by sorting on the numeric field
Create consistent record sequences across different views
Maintain custom ordering that can persist through filtering and other operations

### Requirements
A number field in your table (preferably configured as an integer)
A view with the desired record ordering

After running this script, you can sort any view by the numeric field to reproduce the exact ordering from your source view.
