## What is available in free version ?
- [Detailed comparison of NocoDB's generous CE compared to others is here](https://github.com/orgs/nocodb/projects/13).
- NocoDB has just one version that is free & open source.
- In it you will notice advanced features are all available for free.
    - ACL
    - Collaboration
    - Advanced Views : Form View, Gallery View & Kanban View
    - Share View
    - Embed View 
    - Password protected View
    - Automations
    - API Token Support
- And we would never move these features from free to an enterprise version of NocoDB.
- There is no limitations to number of projects, rows or columns either.

## What is the difference between Auth Token and API Token ?

Auth Token is a JWT Token generated based on the logged-in user. By default, the token is only valid for 10 hours. However, you can change the value by defining it using environment variable `NC_JWT_EXPIRES_IN`. If you are passing Auth Token, make sure that the header is called `xc-auth`.

API Token is a Nano ID with a length of 40. If you are passing API Token, make sure that the header is called `xc-token`.

## Do we plan to have an Enterprise Edition?
For features that make sense for enterprises like below - yes 
- SSO, SLA, Organisation wide reports and analytics, 
- Advanced Audit or ACL,  
- Bespoke implementations & integrations,
- A hosted solution.
   
And increasing number of our customers are requesting it.  

## How do we decide if a feature is Enterprise or not ?

- Depends on the effort and whether the intended users are enterprises.
