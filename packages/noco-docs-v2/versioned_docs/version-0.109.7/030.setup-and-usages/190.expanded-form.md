## Overview

Expanded Form allows you to edit a row data in a form. It also shows the activity feed such as user comments or revision history. It can be also shared by others by copying the record URL.

## Expanding a Record

In a grid view, we can hover a row record and a doulbe arrow will be shown. By clicking it, the expanded form will be opened.

Alternatively, we can highlight a cell and press the space bar. The expanded form for the correpsonding row will be opened.

## Activity Feed

In an expanded form, we can click `Toggle Comment View` button to show the activity feed where we can optionally filter out comments only.

## Save Button Option

By default, when we save the form, the expanded form will be closed, i.e. `Save & Exit`. However, if we prefer not to close the form even after saving, we can choose `Save & Stay` mode instead. This is useful when you are editing a long form and you want to save it from time to time.
