  "description": "NocoDB offers users the flexibility to adjust the display height of records within the spreadsheet grid to four distinct levels: Short (the default setting), Medium, Tall, and Extra. This feature proves valuable when working with extensive text columns and multi-select fields, as it enables users to present a greater amount of content within each cell.",
