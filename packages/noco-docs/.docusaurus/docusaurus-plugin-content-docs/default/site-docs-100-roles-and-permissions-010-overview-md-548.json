  "description": "In NocoDB, we have roles that determine what people can do in a Workspace, Database, or Table. You can give a team or a user one of these roles: Admin, Builder, Editor, Commenter, or Viewer. When you invite someone or create a team, you'll set their role level at the beginning, but you can always change it later if needed.",
