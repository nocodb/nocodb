## Overview
Bulk Update extension in NocoDB allows you to update multiple records in a view simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful when you need to make the same change across multiple records, saving you time and effort.

## Updating Records
To update multiple records in a table, follow the steps outlined below:
1. Select the table & associated view you wish to update.
2. Click on the **New Action** button.
3. Select **Field** you want to update.
4. Select Update **Type**:
   - **Set** Value: Set a specific value for the field.
   - **Clear** Value: Clear the field value.
5. Select **Value** you want to set for the field, if option selected is **Set** Value.
6. Click on the **Update Records** button to apply the changes.
7. A confirmation dialog will appear. Number of fields and records to be updated will be displayed. Click on **Confirm Update** to proceed with the update.

You can add multiple actions to update different fields in the table. 

## Managing Actions
The actions added are listed in the **Actions** section. You can:
- **Edit** an action by clicking on the action item in the list & making the necessary changes.
- **Delete** an action by clicking on the delete icon next to the action item.
- **Disable** an action by toggling the switch next to the action item. Disabling an action will prevent it from being applied to the records.

:::warning
- Bulk updates can't be undone. Ensure you review the changes before confirming the update.

:::info
- Bulk updates are applied to all records in the view, including those that are not visible on the current page.
- Bulk updates are specific to the view and are not applied to the entire table.

For any configured bulk update extension, you can reuse the **Update Records** button to repeat the batch update process. This is particularly useful when you need to apply the same changes across multiple records in the future.
