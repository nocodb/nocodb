`⌘` + `K` (or `Ctrl` + `K` on Windows) is a keyboard shortcut to quickly navigate between different workspace, table, view, or a menu items. For example, if you want to quickly navigate to the "API Tokens" page, you can open Quick Actions menu using ⌘+K, type "Token" in the search box and press enter.

This shortcut is often referred to as "Command-K". It's a great way to save time when you're navigating around NocoDB.

Command-K menu can also be accessed via the "Quick Actions" button in the top left corner of the screen.
