# Installing NocoDB with Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It's a great way to set up NocoDB along with its database in a single configuration file.



## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the NocoDB repository from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb
    ```
2. Navigate to the docker-compose directory

    ```bash
    cd nocodb/docker-compose/pg
    ```
3. Start the services using Docker Compose:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start NocoDB along with a PostgreSQL database.

4. Access NocoDB in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8080`.

## Important Notes

- The provided `docker-compose.yml` files are configured to persist data. Make sure the volumes are properly mounted.
- You can customize the `docker-compose.yml` file to change ports, environment variables, or add additional services.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, check the logs using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```
  
- If you need to stop the services, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
  
- Ensure all required ports are available on your host machine.

- For database connection issues, verify the database service is running:
    
        ```bash
        docker-compose ps
        ```
