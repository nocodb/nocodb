For **production** use cases, it is recommended to set at least the following environment variables:

- `NC_DB`: Specifies the connection string for your database. See our example database URLs [here](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb#docker).
- `NC_AUTH_JWT_SECRET`: Defines the secret key used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of authentication tokens.
- `NC_PUBLIC_URL`: Sets the base URL used for constructing URLs in email templates, generating the Swagger documentation URL, and handling backend URL needs. By default, it infers the URL from the incoming request on the backend. If the server is behind a proxy, this may result in incorrect URLs. Setting this explicitly ensures consistency across the application.
- `NC_REDIS_URL`: Provides the connection string for your Redis server. Redis is used for caching and improving performance, so setting this variable ensures NocoDB can connect to your Redis instance.

The following table lists all the environment variables that can be set to configure NocoDB:

| Variable | Description | If absent                                                                                           |
| -------- | ----------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NC_DB` | See our example database URLs [here](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb#docker). | A local SQLite database is created in root folder if `NC_DB` is not set.                            |
| `NC_DB_JSON` | Can be used instead of `NC_DB` and value should be valid knex connection JSON string. |                                                                                                     |

| `LITESTREAM_S3_REGION` | AWS region of the Litestream replication object storage bucket. Note that `LITESTREAM_S3_ENDPOINT` takes precedence if configured (the endpoint URL includes the region). | Defaults to the [default region configured in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-plan-region.html). |
| `LITESTREAM_S3_BUCKET` | Name of the object storage bucket to store the Litestream replication in. | *Litestream replication is disabled if this variable is not set.*                                   |
