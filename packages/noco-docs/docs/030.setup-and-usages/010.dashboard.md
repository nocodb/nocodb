## Setup Your First Super Admin

Once you have started NocoDB, you can visit the dashboard via `example.com`. You will be redirected to `example.com/#/signup`.

Enter your work email and your password.

![signup](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/assets/86527202/f424f935-fef2-4080-8b67-3f6f1bd95c65)

:::info

  Your password has at least 8 letters. No other constraints on case, numbers or special characters.

:::

On signup, landing page has a default project & a table created for you to quickly get started

![landing page](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/assets/86527202/cd09dbeb-f5e1-42e6-92bb-abd4b3ab48bf)

The data will be stored in `NC_DB`. If it is not specified, a local SQLite will be created and used.

:::info

NC_DB is an environment variable used to store the metadata.

### Connecting to External Database

Click on project title in left sidebar to open the project dashboard. On the project dashboard, open `Data Sources` tab. Click on `+ New Source` button to add existing database. 

:::tip

If you are running NocoDB on Docker and your local DB is running on your host machine, your Host Address would be host.docker.internal instead of localhost.

You can click Edit Connection JSON and modify SSL settings in "ssl".

```json
{
  "client": "pg",
  "connection": {
    "host": "<YOUR_HOST>",
    "port": "5432",
    "user": "<YOUR_DB_USER>",
    "password": "<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>",
    "database": "<YOUR_DB_NAME>",
    "ssl": {
      "require": true,
      "rejectUnauthorized": false,
      "sslMode": "no-verify"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

You can click Edit Connection JSON and specify the schema you want to use in "searchPath".

```

Click `Test Database Connection` to see if the connection can be established or not. NocoDB creates a new **empty database** with specified parameters if the database doesn't exist.
