### Example organization structure

Consider an organization with
- 5 departments (company departments), each department has a team name & associated team code. Each `Team` **has many** `Employees` - relationship has been defined using `LinkToAnotherRecord` or `Links`column
- 5 employees working at different departments

Now, let's explore procedure to retrieve team-code information in Employee table using **LOOKUP** columns

### Configuring a lookup column
- Add new column : Click on '+' icon to the left of column headers in Employee table
- Feed column name
- Select column type as 'Lookup'
- Choose child table
- Select child column
- Click on 'Save'

![lookup create](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb/assets/86527202/45f2757e-9cc5-4eff-903d-d59ad812abb0)


Required information is now populated in the newly created column

## Additional notes
- Nested 'Lookup' supported: a Lookup field can have its child column datatype as Lookup (or Rollup).
