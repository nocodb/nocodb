## What's a View?

In a table, you can use different views to display your data. You can show specific fields in a View. You can also apply Sorting or Filtering to the View. Each View is independent, which means the configuration applying to View 1 will not apply to View 2. 

To navigate different views, we can select the target one in the view sidebar. By default, Grid View will be created for you after creating the table. You can create multiple views of a type, as long as they have unique View names.

## View Types

### Grid View

Grid View, as a default type of view, allows you to display your data in a spreadsheet-like interface.

### Form View

Form View allows you to arrange fields in a form to input data.

You can drag-drop columns from the form to form-field-menu-bar as required.

### Gallery View

Gallery View allows you to display images as thumbnails with other fields just like a gallery.

## View Permission Types

We can apply permission to each View. By default, Collaborative Views will be used. To see or change the view type, expand `view-tool-bar-menu` as shown below.
