In NocoDB, workspaces play a pivotal role in facilitating collaborative and organized data management. A workspace serves as a container for one or more bases, allowing users to bring together interconnected tables, views, and various elements into a unified and coherent entity. Workspaces allow for the assignment of specific access permissions to workspace members, ensuring that data security and privacy are maintained while enabling effective teamwork.

To begin, you can [create a workspace](/workspaces/create-workspace) tailored to your project. Collaborate seamlessly by [inviting team members](/workspaces/workspace-collaboration) to the workspace. If roles need adjustment, simply [modify a team member's role](/workspaces/workspace-collaboration#modify-workspace-member-roles). When necessary, you can also [remove team members](/workspaces/workspace-collaboration#remove-workspace-members) from the workspace. For organizational purposes, renaming the workspace is straightforward with the [rename workspace](/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#rename-workspace) feature. Finally, if a workspace is no longer needed, you can easily [delete it](/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#delete-workspace). 

:::info
The Open Source NocoDB includes a default workspace, and it does not allow the creation of additional workspaces.
