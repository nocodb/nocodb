Upon signing up to NocoDB, an initial workspace is automatically generated on your behalf.
Then you have the ability to either [modify its name](/workspaces/actions-on-workspace#rename-workspace) or creating an entirely new workspace.

In the following section, lets look at the process of creating your NocoDB workspaces.

## Create a workspace

1. Navigate to the top-left corner of the sidebar and select the **Workspace name** to access the **Workspace context menu**.
2. From the Workspace context menu, opt for the **Create workspace** button.
3. Provide a name for the workspace 
4. Proceed by clicking the **Create Workspace** button.

When you start a new workspace, you automatically become the owner. 
Once your workspace is set up, you can [create tables](/tables/create-table) and [invite others](/workspaces/workspace-collaboration) to join and work together. 
You can invite as many people as you want, and you can create as many tables as you need in your workspace. 
But remember, there can only be one owner, and only the owner can delete the workspace. 

:::info
The Open Source NocoDB includes a default workspace, and it does not allow the creation of additional workspaces.
