## Embeddable Frame

The NocoDB interface can be seamlessly integrated into existing applications through the utilization of the [HTML IFRAME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) attribute. This feature empowers users to embed the NocoDB interface into their applications, allowing for a unified user experience. To generate the embeddable HTML code, follow these steps:

**To Generate Embeddable HTML Code:**
1. Click the `Share` button located in the top right corner of the toolbar.
2. Within the `Shared base link` tab, select the button to copy the `Embeddable HTML code` to your clipboard.
