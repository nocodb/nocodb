- Snapshots are available only in Cloud-hosted plans currently.

Snapshots are a powerful feature that allows users to create a point-in-time backup of their base. Whether youâ€™re preparing for major changes or safeguarding against accidental data loss, this feature ensures your data is secure and retrievable.

Please note the following:
- Snapshots does not include audit log data (revision history)
- Restoring a snapshot will not have any impact on the existing base
- Restoring a snapshot will create a new base with-in the same workspace
- Restoring a snapshot will not restore base specific user permissions. A restored base will have default workspace permissions applied. Any custom permissions required at base level will need to be re-applied.
- Restoring a snapshot will not restore any shared base or shared view related configurations originally present in the source base. These will need to be re-configured.
- A maximum of 2 snapshots are allowed per base currently
- There should be a gap of at least 3 hours between two snapshots
  - One can still delete all existing snapshots and create a new one immediately

Snapshot menu is accessible only for Base Owners.
