Snapshots are a powerful feature that allows users to create a point-in-time backup of their base. Whether you’re preparing for major changes or safeguarding against accidental data loss, this feature ensures your data is secure and retrievable.

:::note
- Snapshots are currently available exclusively on Cloud-hosted plans.

### Key Notes

#### 1. Audit Log Exclusion 
- Snapshots do not include audit log data (revision history).

#### 2. No Impact on Existing Base  
- Restoring a snapshot does not modify the current base. Instead, it creates a new base within the same workspace.

#### 3. Permissions Handling  
- Base-specific user permissions are not restored. Restored bases inherit default workspace permissions.  
- Any custom base-level permissions must be re-applied manually.

#### 4. Shared Configurations  
- Shared base or shared view settings from the source base are not restored. These need to be reconfigured in the restored base.

#### 5. Snapshot Limits  
- Each base can have a maximum of two snapshots at a time.  
- A minimum gap of three hours is required between creating two snapshots.  
- You can delete all existing snapshots and immediately create a new one if needed.

#### 6. Base Owner Access  
- Only Base Owners can access the snapshot feature.

### Important Notes on Restoring
- A restored snapshot creates a new base within the same workspace. Choosing a different workspace is not supported currently.
- Permissions and shared configurations will need to be set up again as described above.
