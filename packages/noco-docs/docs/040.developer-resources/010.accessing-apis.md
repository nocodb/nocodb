---

NocoDB APIs can be authorized by either Auth Token or API Token.

## Auth Token

Auth Token is a JWT Token generated based on the logged-in user. By default, the token is only valid for 10 hours. However, you can change the value by defining it using environment variable `NC_JWT_EXPIRES_IN`. If you are passing Auth Token, make sure that the header is called `xc-auth`.

- Go to NocoDB Project, click on `Nocodb` on top left, ``Copy Auth Token``.

## API Token

API tokens allows us to integrate seamlessly with 3rd party apps. See [API Tokens Management](../setup-and-usages/team-and-auth#api-tokens-management) for more.

## Swagger UI

You can interact with the API's resources via Swagger UI.

- Open project context menu, select ``Swagger: REST APIs``.

- Click ``Authorize``, paste the token you copied in above steps and click `Authorize` to save.
