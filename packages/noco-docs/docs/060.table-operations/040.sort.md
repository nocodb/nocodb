Sorting enables you to arrange your data alphabetically (A → Z) or (Z → A) for text based types and in ascending or descending order for numerical types. NocoDB supports nested sorting, allowing you to select fields and the order in which to apply nested sorting. 

### Adding or Editing Sort

1. Click the `Sort` button in the toolbar menu.
2. Choose the `Field` to sort by.
3. Configure the sorting `Direction` : ascending or descending

- You can configure multiple fields for subsequent-level sorting.
