# Display Value

The `Display Value`, as its name suggests, serves as the primary or main value within a record of a table, and it is typically the attribute by which we identify or associate that specific record. While it is advisable for the display value to be linked to a field with unique identifiers, such as a primary key, it's important to note that this uniqueness is not always enforced at the database level.

## Use of Display Value
- Within a spreadsheet, `Display Value` are always highlighted so that it is easier to recognise what record we are working with.
- And when `Links` are created between two tables - it is the Display Value that appears in `Linked records` modal.

Example: 
Display Value highlighted in Actor table
![display value](/img/v2/fields/display-value.png)

Display Value associated when Links field  
The value shown in `Link Records` modal when adding a new link is associated records `Display value`

How is Display Value identified for existing database tables ?
- It is usually the first field after the primary key which is not a number.
- If there is no field which is not a number then the field adjacent to primary key is chosen.

Can I change the Display Value to another field within tables ?
- Yes, you can use the same way mentioned above to set Display Value.
