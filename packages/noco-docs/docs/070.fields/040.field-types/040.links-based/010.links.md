`Links` field type is used to establish relationship between tables & create links to other records.
NocoDB supports following types of relations:
- `Has-Many` - A record in one table can have multiple records in another table.
  - Example: A `Country` can have multiple `Cities`.
- `Belongs-to` - Multiple records in one table can have a single record in another table.
  - Example: A `City` `Belongs-to` a `Country`.
- `Many-to-Many` - Multiple records in one table can have multiple records in another table.
  - Example: A `Student` can have multiple `Subjects` & a `Subject` can have multiple `Students`.

:::note
- Links can be created only between tables in the same database.
- Self-referencing links are supported. (Link to the same table)
- For every `Has-Many` relation defined, NocoDB augments `Belongs-to` relationship field in the adjacent table automatically

## Limit record selection
This feature enables users to restrict the records available for selection within the `Link records` modal. This can be achieved by two modes:
- Limit by view
- Limit by filter ☁

Note that,
- These options are not mutually exclusive & can be used together. When both are used, the records available for selection will be the **intersection of the records satisfying all conditions**.
- This feature only affects the records available for selection & **does not affect the existing links**.
- The limit is applied only on the **Link records** modal & does not restrict the link modification process via API, Copy-Paste or any other mechanisms.
- **Limit by filter** option is available only in cloud version.

### Limit by view
To limit the records available for selection based on a view, follow the steps below:
#### Steps
1. Enable `Limit record selection to view`
2. Select the view from the dropdown
3. Click on `Save Field` button

![image](/img/v2/fields/types/limit-by-view.png)

In the example image above, the records available for selection will be limited to the records available in `Trailers` view.

Note that,
- Only one view can be selected at a time.
- Deleting the view associated with links field will disable the limit by view option.
- Change in filters within the view will also reflect records available for selection during linking.

### Limit by filter ☁
To limit the records available for selection based on filters, follow the steps below:
#### Steps
1. Enable `Limit record selection by filter`
2. Configure filter
 - Click on `Add filter` button.
 - Select the field, operator
 - Configure value
3. Click on `Save Field` button

![image](/img/v2/fields/types/limit-by-filter.png)

In the example image above, the records available for selection will be limited to the records available in `Trailers` view where `rating` is `PG`.

Note that,
- Multiple filters can be added.
- Deleting the field associated with links field will disable associated filters.

#### Filter Type
Conditions in the filter can be of two types: Static & Dynamic.
- **Static condition**: Filter value is a constant value.
- **Dynamic condition**: Filter value is a field value from the current record.

Use the ⚙️ icon to the right of the filter to toggle between static & dynamic filter values.
