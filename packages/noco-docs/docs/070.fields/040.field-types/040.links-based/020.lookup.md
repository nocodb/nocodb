`Lookup` fields help bring additional field information from related table into the current table. This is useful when you want to display additional information about a record in a table. For example, if you have a table of `Orders` and a table of `Customers`, you can use a `Lookup` field to display the customer's name and address in the `Orders` table.

:::note
- Lookup fields are read-only. You cannot edit the values in a lookup field.
- Lookup fields are available only for `Belongs-to` relational links in hosted cloud version. The additional processing complexity for `Has-many` and `Many-to-many` relational links outweighs the benefits of having lookup fields for these links. OSS will continue to support lookup fields for all relational links.
