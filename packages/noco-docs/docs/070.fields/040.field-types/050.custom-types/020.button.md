The **Button** Field allows users to create interactive buttons within their tables. These buttons can trigger specific actions, making workflows more dynamic and efficient. With the Button Field, you can navigate to external URLs, run custom webhooks, or even run custom scripts (coming soon!) with a single click.

NocoDB currently supports two types of actions for the Button Field:
1. **Open URL**: Opens a new tab with a URL generated by a formula within the button field. The URL can be static or dynamic based on the current record's data.
2. **Run Webhook**: Trigger a webhook with the configured URL & custom payload. Payload can include data from the current record.
