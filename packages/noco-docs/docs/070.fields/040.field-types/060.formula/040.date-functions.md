This cheat sheet provides a quick reference guide for various date functions commonly used in data analysis and programming. Each function is accompanied by its syntax, a sample usage, and a brief description.


## DATETIME_DIFF
The DATETIME_DIFF function calculates the difference between two dates in various units.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
DATETIME_DIFF(date1, date2, ["milliseconds" | "ms" | "seconds" | "s" | "minutes" | "m" | "hours" | "h" | "days" | "d" | "weeks" | "w" | "months" | "M" | "quarters" | "Q" | "years" | "y"])
```

#### Sample
```plaintext
DATETIME_DIFF("2022/10/14", "2022/10/15", "seconds") => -86400
```

#### Remark
This function compares two dates and returns the difference in the specified unit. Positive integers indicate that second date is in the past compared to first, and vice versa for negative values.

## DATEADD
The DATEADD function adds a specified value to a date or datetime.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
DATEADD(date | datetime, value, ["day" | "week" | "month" | "year"])
```

#### Sample
```plaintext
DATEADD('2022-03-14', 1, 'day')     => 2022-03-15
DATEADD('2022-03-14', 1, 'week')    => 2022-03-21
DATEADD('2022-03-14', 1, 'month')   => 2022-04-14
DATEADD('2022-03-14', 1, 'year')    => 2023-03-14
```

#### Conditional Example
```plaintext
IF(NOW() < DATEADD(date, 10, 'day'), "true", "false") => If the current date is less than the specified date plus 10 days, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
```

#### Remark
This function supports date and datetime fields and can handle negative values.

## NOW
The NOW function returns the current time and day.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
NOW()
```

#### Sample
```plaintext
NOW() => 2022-05-19 17:20:43 (current date & time)
```

#### Conditional Example
```plaintext
IF(NOW() < date, "true", "false") => If the current date is less than the specified date, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
```

#### Remark
This function provides the current time and day, supporting datetime fields and negative values.

---

## WEEKDAY
The WEEKDAY function returns the day of the week as an integer.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
WEEKDAY(date, [startDayOfWeek])
```

#### Sample
```plaintext
WEEKDAY(NOW()) => If today is Monday, it returns 0.
WEEKDAY(NOW(), "sunday") => If today is Monday, it returns 1.
```

#### Remark
Returns the day of the week as an integer between 0 and 6 (inclusive), with Monday as the default start day. The start day of the week can be optionally changed by specifying it as the second argument.
