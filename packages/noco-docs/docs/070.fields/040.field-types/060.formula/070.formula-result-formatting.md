### Decimal
The `Decimal format` is used to display results with a specified number of decimal places, allowing you to define the precision.

### Currency
The `Currency format` is ideal for displaying monetary values, with the option to set and display a specific currency symbol.

### Percent
The `Percent format` displays results as a number and includes an option to configure it as a progress bar.

### Rating
The `Rating format` is ideal for ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. It allows you to customize the icon, color, and choose the maximum rating value within that range.



## Date Formats

### Date Time
The `Date Time format` displays both date and time values.

### Date
The `Date format` displays only the date values, with a wide range of date formats available.

### Time

## Text Formats

### Email
The `Email format` is used to display results as clickable email links. When an email address is detected in the formula output, it will be formatted as a mailto link, allowing users to click and open their default email client to send an email.

### URL
The `URL format` is designed to display results as clickable web links. When a valid URL is recognized in the formula output, it will be formatted as a hyperlink, enabling users to click and navigate directly to the specified web address.

### Phone Number
The `Phone number format` is ideal for displaying the results as phone numbers. 


## Boolean Format

### Checkbox
When NocoDB recognizes a formula's output as a Boolean result, you can apply the `Checkbox format` to display it in a manner similar to a checkbox field. You can customize icon and color as required.
