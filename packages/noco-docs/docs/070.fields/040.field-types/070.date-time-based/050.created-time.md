Since version v0.204.0 (Jan 2024), NocoDB internally captures the time when record was created. This information is stored as a system field in the database & is hidden in the table by default. To view this information on the UI, you can either enable `Show System Fields` OR create a `Created Time` field manually by following the steps below.

Default system field can be only hidden from UI. It cannot be modified, duplicated or deleted.

:::note
- When connected to an external database, `CreatedTime` field is not created automatically. You can create a `CreatedTime` field manually by following the steps below.
- `CreatedTime` field is empty indicates the record predates the created at feature (v0.204.0, Jan 2024). Prior to this feature release, it was possible to remove this from the table.
:::
