Since version v0.204.0 (Jan 2024), NocoDB internally captures the time when record was modified. This information is stored as a system field in the database & is hidden in the table by default. To view this information on the UI, you can either enable `Show System Fields` OR create a `Last Modified Time` field manually by following the steps below.

Default system field can be only hidden from UI. It cannot be modified, duplicated or deleted.

:::note
- When connected to an external database, `LastModifiedTime` field is not created automatically. You can create a `LastModifiedTime` field manually by following the steps below.
- `LastModifiedTime` field is empty indicates 
  - the record predates the `LastModifiedTime` feature (v0.204.0, Jan 2024). Prior to this feature release, it was possible to remove the `LastModifiedTime` field from the table.
  - the record was never modified.
  - external database connection : information is captured only after the field is explicitly created.
:::
