`User` field type allows you to assign a user from your current workspace to a record. For example, you can create a `Task` table with a `User` field type to assign a task to a user. You can also configure the field to allow assigning multiple users to a record.

## Create a User field
1. Click on `+` icon to the right of `Fields header`
2. On the dropdown modal, enter the field name (Optional).
3. Select the field type as `User` from the dropdown.
4. Configure `Allow adding multiple users` toggle field (Optional).
5. Configure default value (Optional)
6. Click on `Save Field` button.

### Cell display
`User` field display is quite identical to `Select` field. It is displayed as a dropdown in the table view. Click on the dropdown to select a user. If `Allow adding multiple users` is enabled, you can select multiple users from the dropdown.

:::note
- If a user is removed from workspace, the user will be removed from the dropdown list. If such user was assigned to a record already, the user will be displayed as is.
- To remove a user from a record, click on the `x` icon next to the user name.
- If display name is not set for a user, the user's email address will be displayed.
