Since version v0.204.0 (Jan 2024), NocoDB internally captures the user who created a record. This information is stored as a system field in the database & is not included in the table by default. To view this information on the table, you can create a `Created By` field manually by following the steps below.

## Create a `Created By` field
1. Click on `+` icon to the right of `Fields header`
2. On the dropdown modal, enter the field name (Optional).
3. Select the field type as `CreatedBy` from the dropdown.
4. Click on `Save Field` button.

- `Created By` field is empty indicates the record either
  - predates the created by feature (v0.204.0, Jan 2024). Prior to this feature release, this information was not captured.

## Cell display
`Created By` field is displayed as a read-only field in the table view. Displays email address of the user who created the record if the user has no display name set. If the user has a display name set, the display name is displayed.
