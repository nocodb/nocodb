Since version v0.204.0 (Jan 2024), NocoDB internally captures the user who last modified a record. This information is stored as a system field in the database & is not included in the table by default. To view this information on the table, you can create a `Last Modified By` field manually by following the steps below.

## Create a `Last Modified By` field
1. Click on `+` icon to the right of `Fields header`
2. On the dropdown modal, enter the field name (Optional).
3. Select the field type as `LastModifiedBy` from the dropdown.
4. Click on `Save Field` button.

:::note
- When connected to an external database, user last modifying record information is not captured automatically. You can create a `Last Modified By` field manually by following the steps above. For external database connections, this field is not a system field & can be deleted.
- `Last Modified By` field is empty indicates the record either
  - record was created & never modified. 
  - predates the last modified by feature (v0.204.0, Jan 2024). Prior to this feature release, this information was not captured.
  - external database connection : information is captured only after the field is explicitly created.
- `Last Modified By` field is not updated when a record is initially created (is initialized to NULL).
:::

## Cell display
`Last Modified By` field is displayed as a read-only field in the table view. Displays email address of the user who last modified the record if the user has no display name set. If the user has a display name set, the display name is displayed.
