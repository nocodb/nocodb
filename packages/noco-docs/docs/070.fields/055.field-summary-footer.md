The "Field Summary" provides quick calculations for chosen fields displayed in the footer of a table's grid view. These calculations offer quick insights into your data, such as total sums, averages, minimum, and maximum values.

This section explains how to use & configure field summary to accurately compute these values.


## Overview

Field Summary is aggregated value computed by considering all the rows present in a grid view. The resulting values are displayed in the summary cells at the bottom of the field for easy reference. Filters configured on the grid, if any will affect the rows displayed & hence the summary as well.

Please note that it is not possible to reference these aggregated values directly in other parts of the table.

When a grid view is **shared publicly**, the summary  is also visible to the viewers. Viewers of shared view can also modify the field summary configuration to suit their needs, but the changes are not saved (revert upon page refresh).

Summary configurations are grid **view specific**. Multiple grid views can be created for a table, and each grid view can have its own summary configuration.


## Configuring Field Summary 

By default, the summary is disabled for all fields. To enable the summary for a field, follow these steps:

Navigate to the grid view of the table you wish to configure the field summary for.
1. Click on the cell of the field you wish to configure the summary for.
2. Select the desired summary type from the dropdown list.

Changes to the grid view immediately update the values displayed in the footer cells. To disable the summary for a field, click on the summary cell and select "None" from the dropdown list.
