Sharing a specific view of a table becomes highly valuable when you need to collaborate with individuals outside your organization who need access to specific sections of your database. This shared view provides a read-only perspective, accessible to anyone, regardless of their workspace affiliation. You have control over which data fields and records are visible to these external viewers, ensuring that any sensitive data remains hidden. Furthermore, if you decide to make changes to the visible fields or records within the view, the shared link will promptly reflect these adjustments, updating in real-time.

## Generate Share View
1. Click `Share` button on the top right of the toolbar
2. Toggle `Enable public viewing` to create shared view link
3. Click `Copy` button to copy the link to clipboard

Users with the shared view link can only view the data and cannot make any changes to the view or its content. Records and fields in the shared view will be updated in real-time as changes are made to the original view. Users accessing shared view can apply filters and sort records as per their requirements.

:::info
Note that, filters & sorts applied to shared view will not be persisted. These filters & sorts will be reset when the shared view is accessed again.
