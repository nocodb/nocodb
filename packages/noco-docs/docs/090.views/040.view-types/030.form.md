3. **Appearance Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view appearance settings like Background Color, Banner & Branding.
4. **Post Form Submission Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view to perform various actions after a form is submitted.

## Prefill Form Fields
Here's a more professional rephrasing of the given content:

## Pre-Filling Form Fields
NocoDB offers a convenient feature that allows pre-filling form fields with specific values by setting URL parameters. This functionality enables the creation of custom URLs with desired field values, streamlining data entry and enhancing user experience.

To construct a pre-filled form URL manually, ensure that the URL parameters are appropriately encoded in the following format: `?key1=value1&key2=value2`. 

For instance, the URL `https://wh8s5w.noco.to/#/nc/form/66da06-f074-47af-ace7-fde46df55?Status=Qualification&Priority=Very+high` pre-fills the `Status` field with `Qualification` and the `Priority` field with `Very high`.

NocoDB provides an intuitive alternative approach to generate pre-filled URLs through the form builder. 
1. Open the form builder and pre-fill the required form fields with the desired values.
2. Click on the `Share` button located in the top right corner.
3. Toggle the `Enable Public Viewing` button to enable sharing.
4. Toggle the `Enable Prefill` button to enable pre-filling.
5. Click on the `Copy Link` button to copy the pre-filled URL.


![Prefill](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill.png)
![Prefill share](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-share.png)

:::info
- Prefilled fields override the default values if any were set for this field in the table
- Maximum length of the URL is 8000 characters.
:::

### Prefill modes
1. **Default**: Standard mode. This mode will prefill the form fields with the values set in the shared form URL. Users can edit the prefilled fields in the form. In the image below, the `Number` field is prefilled with the value `1234`, `Currency` field is prefilled with the value `1000` and `Year` field is prefilled with value `2023`.  

   ![Prefill default](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-default.png)

2. **Hide prefilled fields**: This mode will prefill the form fields with the values set in the shared form URL but will hide the prefilled fields in the form from the user. In the image below, the `Number` field is prefilled with the value `1234`, `Currency` field is prefilled with the value `1000` and `Year` field is prefilled with value `2023`.

  ![Prefill hide](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-hide.png)

3. **Lock prefilled fields as read-only**: This mode will prefill the form fields with the values set in the shared form URL and will lock the prefilled fields as read-only. In the image below, the `Number` field is prefilled with the value `1234`, `Currency` field is prefilled with the value `1000` and `Year` field is prefilled with value `2023`. 

  ![Prefill lock](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-lock.png)

:::info
In any of the modes, the user can still change the prefilled fields by editing the URL.
