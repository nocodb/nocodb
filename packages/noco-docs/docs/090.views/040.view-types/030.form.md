## Form View Builder 
Form view builder layout can be divided into 3 sections:
1. **Fields Area** - This is the area where fields available in the tables that are not yet added to the form are listed. 
2. **Form Area** - This is the area where fields added to the form are listed.
3. **Form Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view. This mainly consists of actions & customisations that can be performed after a form view is submitted.
