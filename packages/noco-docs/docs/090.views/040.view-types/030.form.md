## Form View Builder 
Form view builder layout can be divided into 4 sections:
1. **Form Area** - This is the area where fields added to the form are listed. This area also acts as a preview of the form.
2. **Form Fields** - This area lists all the fields available in the table. You can drag and drop fields for re-ordering and toggle the `hide` switch to remove fields from the form.
3. **Appearance Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view appearance settings like Background Color, Banner & Branding.
4. **Post Form Submission Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view to perform various actions after a form is submitted.

:::info
Formatting options are supported for the `After Submit Message` field. You can also use Markdown to format the text.
:::

### Redirect URL
To redirect the user to a specific URL after the form is submitted, toggle the `Redirect URL` switch in the **Post Form Submission Settings** panel and enter the URL in the input box provided. The browser will redirect to the specified URL after the form is submitted instead of showing the default success message & "Submit Another Form" button.

![Redirect URL](/img/v2/views/form-view/form-redirect-url.png)

You can use **`{record_id}`** in the URL as a query parameter to display the newly created record as expanded form (provided user submitting form has access to the base). For example, `https://app.nocodb.com/#/<workspaceId>/<baseId>/<tableId>?rowId={record_id}`

You can also use **`{record_id}`** in the URL as query parameter to pass the record ID of the newly created record to link in subsequent form. For example, if you want a link field in another table to be populated based on the record just created, you can use the shared form URL with link field prefilled appropriately `https://<shared form URL>?<link field>={record_id}`

:::note
Use of Redirect URL is mutually exclusive with the `After Submit missage`, `Show a Blank form` and `Submit Another Form` options. If Redirect URL is enabled, the form will redirect to the specified URL after submission.
:::

## Prefill Form Fields
Here's a more professional rephrasing of the given content:

## Pre-Filling Form Fields
NocoDB offers a convenient feature that allows pre-filling form fields with specific values by setting URL parameters. This functionality enables the creation of custom URLs with desired field values, streamlining data entry and enhancing user experience.

To construct a pre-filled form URL manually, ensure that the URL parameters are appropriately encoded in the following format: `?key1=value1&key2=value2`. 

For instance, the URL `https://wh8s5w.noco.to/#/nc/form/66da06-f074-47af-ace7-fde46df55?Status=Qualification&Priority=Very+high` pre-fills the `Status` field with `Qualification` and the `Priority` field with `Very high`.

NocoDB provides an intuitive alternative approach to generate pre-filled URLs through the form builder. 
1. Open the form builder and pre-fill the required form fields with the desired values.
2. Click on the `Share` button located in the top right corner.
3. Toggle the `Enable Public Viewing` button to enable sharing.
4. Toggle the `Enable Prefill` button to enable pre-filling.
5. Click on the `Copy Link` button to copy the pre-filled URL.


![Prefill](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill.png)
![Prefill share](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-share.png)

:::info
- Prefilled fields override the default values if any were set for this field in the table
- Maximum length of the URL is 8000 characters.
:::

### Prefill modes
1. **Default**: Standard mode. This mode will prefill the form fields with the values set in the shared form URL. Users can edit the prefilled fields in the form. In the image below, the `Number` field is prefilled with the value `1234`, `Currency` field is prefilled with the value `1000` and `Year` field is prefilled with value `2023`.  

   ![Prefill default](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-default.png)

2. **Hide prefilled fields**: This mode will prefill the form fields with the values set in the shared form URL but will hide the prefilled fields in the form from the user. In the image below, the `Number` field is prefilled with the value `1234`, `Currency` field is prefilled with the value `1000` and `Year` field is prefilled with value `2023`.

  ![Prefill hide](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-hide.png)

3. **Lock prefilled fields as read-only**: This mode will prefill the form fields with the values set in the shared form URL and will lock the prefilled fields as read-only. In the image below, the `Number` field is prefilled with the value `1234`, `Currency` field is prefilled with the value `1000` and `Year` field is prefilled with value `2023`. 

  ![Prefill lock](/img/v2/views/form-view/prefill-lock.png)

:::info
In any of the modes, the user can still change the prefilled fields by editing the URL.

## Survey Form View
