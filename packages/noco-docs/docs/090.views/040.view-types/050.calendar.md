Calendar View allows you to visualise your data in a calendar format. You can easily rearrange the records by dragging and dropping them to different dates. You can also visualise the records in a day, week, month, or year format. This section will cover all the operations that can be performed on the Calendar view.

## Configuring Date Range
:::note
The date range for the calendar view is supported only in the Cloud version of NocoDB.
:::

![date-range](/img/v2/views/calendar/cal-range-3.png)

In NocoDB, you can configure the date range display in the calendar view by selecting Start and End date fields. To specify the date range while setting up the calendar view, click on `+ End Date` and choose the desired date field to serve as the end date. This displays the records in the calendar view as a range block between the start and end date.

![date-range](/img/v2/views/calendar/cal-range-1.png)

:::note
The date range configuration is currently supported only for the Date field type. Support for DateTime field type will be added in the future.
:::

Alternatively, you can also configure the date range display functionality during view creation. To do this, click on `+ Add Field` and choose the desired date field to serve as the end date. 

![date-range](/img/v2/views/calendar/cal-range-4.png)

Once the date range display is enabled, you can drag drop the records to change the start and end dates of the records. You can also resize the records to change the duration of the records.
