Here’s the updated article, now including the precedence rules and visual explanation based on your screenshot:


## URL-based record filtering

NocoDB enables users to dynamically filter records using query parameters directly in the URL. This is useful when creating sharable views or automating filtered data access in embedded dashboards or internal workflows.

### Basic Syntax

Filtering is controlled using the `where` query parameter in the following format:

```plaintext
?where=(<field>,<operator>,<value>)
```

#### Example

```plaintext
https://<your-nocodb-url>/#/baseID/tableID?where=(country,eq,France)
https://<your-nocodb-url>/#/baseID/tableID/viewID?where=(country,eq,France)
```

This filters records where the field `country` is equal to `France`.


### Supported Operators
List of supported operators for filtering across various data types are listed below
- [Comparison Operators](/developer-resources/rest-APIs/overview#comparison-operators)
- [Comparison Sub Operators](/developer-resources/rest-APIs/overview#comparison-sub-operators)
- [Logical Operators](/developer-resources/rest-APIs/overview#logical-operators)


### Combining Filters

Multiple conditions can be joined using logical operators:

* `~and` → logical AND
* `~or` → logical OR

#### Example

```plaintext
?where=((country,eq,France)~or(country,eq,Germany))
```

This retrieves records where `country` is either France or Germany.

```plaintext
?where=((country,eq,France)~and(status,eq,Active))
```

This retrieves records where both conditions are true.

---

Conditions can be grouped using nested parentheses to form complex logic:

```plaintext
?where=(((country,eq,France)~or(country,eq,Germany))~and(status,eq,Active))
```


### Filter Precedence: Toolbar vs URL

:::info
Toolbar filters take precedence over URL filters.
:::

This means:

* Filters applied manually via the **Filter** menu are evaluated first.
* Then, the URL query parameter filters (`?where=...`) are applied on top of the results.

**Visual Indicator**: As shown in the screenshot below, the toolbar clearly lists both types of filters:

* The user-applied filter: `Segment is equal to Government`
* The URL-applied filter: `Country is equal to France` (listed under **URL Filters**)

### Additional Notes

* Field names must be exact (case-sensitive).
* URL values must be URL-encoded if they include spaces or special characters.
