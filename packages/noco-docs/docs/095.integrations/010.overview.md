**Integrations** enable seamless connectivity between NocoDB and external platforms. This helps consolidate your data scattered across multiple silos into one common platform.

You can add multiple instances of an integration within a single workspace, with each instance referred to as a **Connection**. Once established, these connections allow you to utilize data from the integrated platforms in your NocoDB base. If applicable, changes made in NocoDB can also be synchronized back to the external platforms.

Currently, NocoDB supports integrations with databases such as _MySQL_ and _PostgreSQL_, with additional integrations planned for the future. If you have a specific integration in mind, please let us know by submitting your request using "**Request Integration**" option in the `Integrations` menu.
