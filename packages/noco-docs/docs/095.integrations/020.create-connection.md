Users with Workspace Owner or Workspace Creator roles can create a new connection in NocoDB. To create a new connection, follow the steps below:

![Integrations](/img/v2/integrations/integrations-2.png)

1. Click on the `Integrations` menu in the left sidebar.
2. From the list, click on the integration you want to connect to 
3. In the subsequent modal, provide required details. Please refer to the integration-specific documentation for more details.
   - [PostgreSQL](#postgresql)
   - [MySQL](#mysql)

Connection to an integration thus created will be listed in the `Connections` tab under the `Integrations` menu.

:::info
Note that, there is no ownership concept for connections in NocoDB. All the connections created in a workspace are accessible to all eligible users in that workspace.
- Users with **Workspace Creator+** permissions can create, edit, duplicate, and delete connections
- Users with **Base Creator+** permissions can create data sources using database connections

## Database Integrations

### PostgreSQL 
This section covers the details required to create a new PostgreSQL connection in NocoDB.

![PostgreSQL Connection](/img/v2/integrations/postgres-connection.png)

1. **Connection Name**: Name for this connection for display on NocoDB UI
2. Key in following database connection configuration details
   - **Host Address**: Hostname of the PostgreSQL server
   - **Port Number**: Port number of the PostgreSQL server, default is 5432
   - **Username**: Username to connect to the PostgreSQL server, default is "postgres"
   - **Password**: Password to connect to the PostgreSQL server
   - [Optional] **Database**: Name of the PostgreSQL database to connect to
   - [Optional] **Schema Name**: Name of the schema to connect to
:::info
Note, Database name & Schema name are optional fields when creating a connection. If provided, these details will be filled in by default when creating a new data source using this connection.
:::
3. **Connection parameters**: required if any, can be added as Key-Value pairs
4. **SSL Mode**: This step is required if the connection required is TLS/MTLS for MITM protection. Toggle to enable SSL for the connection & select the SSL mode
   - **Client Certificate**: Upload the client certificate file
   - **Client Key**: Upload the client key file
   - **Root CA**: Upload the Root CA file
5. **Test Database Connection**: Click to verify the connection
6. **Create Connection**: Click to save the data source

The connection thus created will be listed in the `Connections` tab under the `Integrations` menu.

:::note
You can autofill the connection details if you have a connection URL.

:::note
The entire connection parameters can be viewed in JSON form by clicking on the **Advanced Options** and edited as required by database server type.

**Example**: When SSL mode set to "Required-Identity," if the server certificate's common name (cname) differs from the actual DNS/IP used for connection, the connection will fail. To resolve, add "servername" property with same cname value under the SSL section. Additional details are available at [knex configuration options](https://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options).

### MySQL
This section covers the details required to create a new MySQL connection in NocoDB.

![MySQL Connection](/img/v2/integrations/mysql-connection.png)

1. **Connection Name**: Name for this connection for display on NocoDB UI
2. Key in following database connection configuration details
   - **Host Address**: Hostname of the MySQL server
   - **Port Number**: Port number of the MySQL server, default is 3306
   - **Username**: Username to connect to the MySQL server, default is "root"
   - **Password**: Password to connect to the MySQL server
   - [Optional] **Database**: Name of the MySQL database to connect to
:::info
Note, Database name is optional when creating a connection. If provided, it will be filled in by default when creating a new data source using this connection.

3. **Connection parameters**: required if any, can be added as Key-Value pairs
4. **SSL Mode**: This step is required if the connection required is TLS/MTLS for MITM protection. Toggle to enable SSL for the connection & select the SSL mode

   - **Client Key**: Upload the client key file
   - **Root CA**: Upload the Root CA file
5. **Test Database Connection**: Click to verify the connection
6. **Create Connection**: Click to save the data source

The connection thus created will be listed in the `Connections` tab under the `Integrations` menu.

:::note
You can autofill the connection details if you have a connection URL.
