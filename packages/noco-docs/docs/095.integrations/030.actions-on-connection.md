![Connections List](/img/v2/integrations/connections-list.png)

Connections list provides a consolidated view of all the connections in this workspace. The details include
- Connection name, as specified during creation
- Connection type, i.e., the integration type [Example: PG, MySQL]
- Date added, specifies the date when this connection was created
- Added by, specifies the user who created this connection
- Usage, depends on the type of the integration
  - for database type integrations, this would specify the number of data sources using this connection

:::info
Note that, there is no ownership concept for connections in NocoDB. All the connections created in a workspace are accessible to all eligible users in that workspace.
- Users with Workspace Creator+ permissions can create, edit, duplicate, and delete connections
- Users with Base Creator+ permissions can create data sources using these connections
