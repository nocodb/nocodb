To connect to an external data source, follow the steps below:

1. Access Base context menu by clicking on the `Base` name in the left sidebar
2. Select `Data Sources` tab
3. Click on `+ New Data Source` button
4. On the pop-up modal, provide the following details:

   | Field Name    | Description                                                                          |
   |---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Source Name   | Name for this data source for display on NocoDB UI                                   |
   | Database Type | Type of the data source. Currently, NocoDB supports PostgreSQL & MySQL data sources. |
   | Host Address  | Hostname of the data source                                                          |
   | Port Number   | Port number of the data source                                                       |
   | Username      | Username to connect to the database                                                  |
   | Password      | Password to connect to the database                                                  |
   | Database      | Name of the database to connect to                                                   |
   | Schema name   | Name of the schema to connect to                                                     |

4a. Optionally, if the connection required is TLS/MTLS for MITM protection, follow these additional steps below:

   - Click on `SSL & Advanced Parameters`
   - Select `SSL Mode` and upload the client certificate, client key, and Root CA files by clicking on the file.    
   \
   Note: The entire connection parameters can be viewed in json form by clicking on the "Edit connection JSON" and edited as required by database server type.\
   \
   Example: In PostgreSQL when SSL mode set to "Required-Identity," if the server certificate's common name (cname) differs from the actual DNS/IP used for connection, the connection will fail.\
   To resolve, add "servername" property with same cname value under the SSL section. Additional details are available at [knex configuration options](https://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options).
   
5. Click on `Test Database Connection` button to verify the connection
6. Wait for the connection to be verified.   
- After connection is successful, `Submit` button will be enabled.   
- Click on `Submit` button to save the data source.
