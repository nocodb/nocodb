## Inviting members to your base
When a member is added to a workspace, they will carry their assigned role-specific permissions to all the bases within the workspace. To override member permissions to your base, please follow steps outlined below:

1. Go to the left sidebar and select `Base name` to access the `Base Dashboard.`
2. Click on the `Members` tab.
3. Use the dropdown menu to specify the access permissions for the member you wish to collaborate.
4. Finalize the process by assigning the desired role to the user.

:::note
- Any existing user can invite members to the base, but they can only assign a role to new members that is at most equal to their own role.
- Only the base owner / creator can change the role of a base member.

More details about roles & permissions can be found [here](/roles-and-permissions/roles-permissions-overview).
