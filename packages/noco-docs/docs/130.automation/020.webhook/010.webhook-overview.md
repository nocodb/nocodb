NocoDB supports webhooks to notify external systems in real time whenever records are created, updated, or deleted within a table. This allows seamless integration with third-party services by triggering automated workflows or syncing data changes as they happen. Webhooks in NocoDB are **configured per table** and can be tailored with custom payloads, headers, and event-specific triggers to fit diverse automation needs.

This article discusses **Webhook v3**, which is the latest version of webhooks in NocoDB. It includes a new user interface and additional features compared to the previous version. For more information on the differences between webhook v2 and v3, please refer to the [Webhook v2 vs v3](/automation/webhook/webhook-v2-vs-v3) article.

> [Webhook v2](/automation/webhook-v2/webhook-overview) will be deprecated in the future. While it will continue to function for a limited period, all new features and enhancements are exclusive to webhook v3. Users are strongly encouraged to migrate to webhook v3 for continued support and access to the latest functionality.
