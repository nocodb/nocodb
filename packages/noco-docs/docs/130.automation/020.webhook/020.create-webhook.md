### Configuring webhook
  
1. Name of the webhook
2. Select the event for which webhook needs to be triggered  

| Trigger                      | Details                                     |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| After Record Insert          | After a single record is inserted           |
| After Record Update          | After a single record is updated            |
| After Record Delete          | After a single record is deleted            |
| After Multiple Record Insert | After bulk records are inserted             |
| After Multiple Record Update | After bulk records are updated              |
| After Multiple Record Delete | After bulk records are deleted              |
| Manual Trigger               | Manually trigger webhook using button field |

3. Method & URL: Configure the endpoint to which webhook needs to be triggered. Supported methods are GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, HEAD, PATCH
4. Headers & Parameters: Configure Request headers & parameters (optional)
5. Condition: Only records meeting the configured criteria will trigger webhook (optional)
6. Test webhook (with sample payload) to verify if parameter are configured appropriately (optional)

For more information on **Manual Trigger** webhook & its use with **Button** field, refer [here](/fields/field-types/custom-types/button)

### Webhook with conditions
In case of webhook with conditions, only records meeting the configured criteria will trigger webhook. For example, trigger webhook only when `Status` is `Complete`. You can also configure multiple conditions using `AND` or `OR` operators. For example, trigger webhook only when `Status` is `Complete` and `Priority` is `High`.

Webhook will be triggered only when the configured condition wasn't met before the record was updated. For example, if you have configured webhook with condition `Status` `is` `Complete` and `Priority` `is` `High` and you update the record with `Status` `Complete` and `Priority` `Low` to `High`, webhook will be triggered. However, if you update any other fields of the record with `Status` `Complete` and `Priority` `High`, webhook won't be triggered.

In summary, webhook will be triggered only when `Condition(old-record) = false` and `Condition(new-record) = true`.

:::note
**Note:** Conditions are not applicable for Manual Trigger webhook.

### Webhook with custom payload ☁

:::info
This feature is only available in the paid plans, in both cloud & self-hosted.
:::

In the enterprise edition, you can set up a personalized payload for your webhook. Just head to the `Body` tab to make the necessary configurations. Users can utilize [handlebar syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#simple-expressions), which allows them to access and manipulate the data easily.

Use `{{ json event }}` to access the event data. Sample response is as follows
```json
{
  "type": "records.after.insert",
  "id": "0698517a-d83a-4e72-bf7a-75f46b704ad1",
  "data": {
    "table_id": "m969t01blwprpef",
    "table_name": "Table-2",
    "view_id": "vwib3bvfxdqgymun",
    "view_name": "Table-2",
    "rows": [
      {
        "Id": 1,
        "Tags": "Sample Text",
        "CreatedAt": "2024-04-11T10:40:20.998Z",
        "UpdatedAt": "2024-04-11T10:40:20.998Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info
**Note:** The custom payload feature is only available in the enterprise edition.
:::


#### Discord Webhook
Discord webhook can be configured to send messages to a Discord channel. Discord request body should contain content, embeds or attachments, otherwise request will fail. Below is an example of Discord webhook payload. More details can be found [here](https://birdie0.github.io/discord-webhooks-guide/discord_webhook.html)

```json
{
  "content": "Hello, this is a webhook message",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "Webhook",
      "description": "This is a webhook message",
      "color": 16711680
    }
  ]
}
``` 

To send complete event data to Discord, use below payload
```
{
  "content" : {{ json ( json event ) }}
}
```

One can also customize the payload as per the requirement. For example, to send only the `Title` field to Discord, use below payload. Note that, the value of `content` is what that will get displayed in the Discord channel.
```
{
   "content": "{{ event.data.rows.[0].Title }}"
}
```

## Environment Variables
In self-hosted version, you can configure the following environment variables to customize the webhook behavior.
- NC_ALLOW_LOCAL_HOOKS: Allow localhost based links to be triggered. Default: false

Find more about environment variables [here](/getting-started/self-hosted/environment-variables)
