**Extensions** are modular components that allow you to extend the way you interact with NocoDB. In a way, they are like plugins that add new features or functionalities to the platform. Not all features are built into the core of NocoDB, and that's where Extensions come in. Users can now go beyond the default features of NocoDB, tailoring the platform to better fit their specific needs and workflows.

In this section, we will guide you through understanding extensions framework, how to install and manage them, and how they can be used to enhance your base.

Extensions can be developed using JavaScript & Vue.js, providing a flexible way to add new features to your NocoDB instance. Read more about developing extensions [here](/developer-resources/extensions/developing-extensions).
