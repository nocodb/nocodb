You can add multiple actions to update different fields in the table. 

## Managing Actions
The actions added are listed in the **Actions** section. You can:
- **Edit** an action by clicking on the action item in the list & making the necessary changes.
- **Delete** an action by clicking on the delete icon next to the action item.
