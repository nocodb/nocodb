This article briefs about the steps to configure Auth0 as Identity service provider for NocoDB

1. Enable `SAML SSO` on NocoDB
    - Go to `Account Settings` > `Authentication`
    - Activate `SAML` toggle button
2. Retrieve `Redirect URI` & `Audience URI` from NocoDB
    - Go to `Account Settings` > `Authentication` > `SAML`
    - Note down `Redirect URI` & `Audience URI`; these information will be required to be configured later with the Identity Provider
3. Access your [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/)  
    - navigate to `Applications` > `Create Application`.
4. In the `Create Application` modal, 
    - choose `Regular Web Application` 
    - click `Create`
5. Upon successful creation, you will be directed to the `Quick Start` screen. 
    - Go to the `Settings` tab.
    - Paste `Redirect URI` copied in step (2) above into `Allowed Callback URLs` field
    - `Save`
6. Still on the `Settings` tab, 
    - move to `Advanced Settings` > `Endpoints` > `SAML` section, 
    - copy the SAML `Metadata URL` 
7. Configure `Metadata URL` in NocoDB
    - Go to `Account Settings` > `Authentication` > `SAML`
    - Insert `Metadata URL` retrieved in step (6) above; alternatively you can configure XML directly as well
    - `Save`
