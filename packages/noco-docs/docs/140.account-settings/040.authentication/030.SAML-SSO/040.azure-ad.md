1. Enable `SAML SSO` on NocoDB

2. Retrieve `Redirect URI` & `Audience URI` from NocoDB
    - Go to `Account Settings` > `Authentication` > `SAML`
    - Note down `Redirect URI` & `Audience URI`; these information will be required to be configured later with the Identity Provider

        - In the `Source attribute field`, select the option storing the userâ€™s email address.
        - `Save`

        - Click Add new claim, provide details, and save.

    - Add the necessary users or groups to the application.
12. Configure `Metadata URL` in NocoDB
    - Go to `Account Settings` > `Authentication` > `SAML`
