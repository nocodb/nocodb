# OSS to Enterprise Migration

This guide will help you migrate from the OSS to the Enterprise Edition of NocoDB.

## Prerequisites

- You have the OSS version of NocoDB installed (read as **Instance-1**). 
- You have the Enterprise Edition of NocoDB installed (read as **Instance-2**).
- Enterprise Edition is running on v0.262.2 or higher.
- You have admin access to both the instances.
- Enable **OSS to Enterprise migration** from the "Feature preview" section of the Enterprise Edition Instance (Instance-2). Details here: [Enable OSS to Enterprise Migration](#enable-oss-to-enterprise-migration).

## Steps

Entire migration process involves two parts.

### Part 1: Generate Migration URL

On  EE Instance (**Instance-2**), use following steps to generate the migration URL:
1. Click on "Import Data" from base homepage. 
2. Select "NocoDB" as datasource.
3. Click on "Generate & Copy URL".
4. The URL will be copied to the clipboard. Modal will now switch to listening mode, awaiting the trigger for the migration from the OSS instance.
