Once you've created the schemas, you can manipulate the data or invoke actions using the REST APIs. We provide several types of APIs for different usages. Refer to the following links for more details:
- [Meta APIs](https://meta-apis-v2.nocodb.com/)
- [Data APIs](https://data-apis-v2.nocodb.com/)

Additional information on the REST APIs is provided below.

## Comparison Operators

| Operation | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| eq | equal | (colName,eq,colValue) |
| neq | not equal | (colName,neq,colValue) |
| not | not equal (alias of neq) | (colName,not,colValue) |
| gt | greater than | (colName,gt,colValue) |
| ge | greater or equal | (colName,ge,colValue) |
| lt | less than | (colName,lt,colValue) |
| le | less or equal | (colName,le,colValue) |
| is | is | (colName,is,true/false/null) |
| isnot | is not | (colName,isnot,true/false/null) |
| in | in | (colName,in,val1,val2,val3,val4) |
| btw | between | (colName,btw,val1,val2) |
| nbtw | not between | (colName,nbtw,val1,val2) |
| like | like | (colName,like,%name) |
| isWithin | is Within (Available in `Date` and `DateTime` only) | (colName,isWithin,sub_op) |
| allof | includes all of | (colName,allof,val1,val2,...) |
| anyof | includes any of | (colName,anyof,val1,val2,...) |
| nallof | does not include all of (includes none or some, but not all of) | (colName,nallof,val1,val2,...) |
| nanyof | does not include any of (includes none of) | (colName,nanyof,val1,val2,...) |

## Comparison Sub-Operators

The following sub-operators are available in the `Date` and `DateTime` columns.

| Operation       | Meaning                 | Example                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| today           | today                   | (colName,eq,today)                |
| tomorrow        | tomorrow                | (colName,eq,tomorrow)             |
| yesterday       | yesterday               | (colName,eq,yesterday)            |
| oneWeekAgo      | one week ago            | (colName,eq,oneWeekAgo)           |
| oneWeekFromNow  | one week from now       | (colName,eq,oneWeekFromNow)       |
| oneMonthAgo     | one month ago           | (colName,eq,oneMonthAgo)          |
| oneMonthFromNow | one month from now      | (colName,eq,oneMonthFromNow)      |
| daysAgo         | number of days ago      | (colName,eq,daysAgo,10)           |
| daysFromNow     | number of days from now | (colName,eq,daysFromNow,10)       |
| exactDate       | exact date              | (colName,eq,exactDate,2022-02-02) |

For `isWithin` in `Date` and `DateTime` columns, the different set of sub-operators are used.

| Operation        | Meaning                 | Example                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| pastWeek         | the past week           | (colName,isWithin,pastWeek)             |
| pastMonth        | the past month          | (colName,isWithin,pastMonth)            |
| pastYear         | the past year           | (colName,isWithin,pastYear)             |
| nextWeek         | the next week           | (colName,isWithin,nextWeek)             |
| nextMonth        | the next month          | (colName,isWithin,nextMonth)            |
| nextYear         | the next year           | (colName,isWithin,nextYear)             |
| nextNumberOfDays | the next number of days | (colName,isWithin,nextNumberOfDays,10)  |
| pastNumberOfDays | the past number of days | (colName,isWithin,pastNumberOfDays,10)  |

## Logical Operators

| Operation | Example |
|---|---|
| ~or | (checkNumber,eq,JM555205)~or((amount, gt, 200)~and(amount, lt, 2000)) |
| ~and | (checkNumber,eq,JM555205)~and((amount, gt, 200)~and(amount, lt, 2000)) |
| ~not | ~not(checkNumber,eq,JM555205) |
