## API Tokens

NocoDB APIs can be authorized by using API Tokens. API tokens allow us to integrate seamlessly with 3rd party apps. See [API Tokens Management](/account-settings/api-tokens) for more.

## Swagger UI

You can interact with the API's resources via the Swagger UI. For more details, see [Swagger APIs Doc](/bases/actions-on-base#rest-apis)
