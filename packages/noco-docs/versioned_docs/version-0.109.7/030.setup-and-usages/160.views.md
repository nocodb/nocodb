## What's a View?

In a table, you can use different views to display your data. You can show specific fields in a View. You can also apply Sorting or Filtering to the View. Each View is independent, which means the configuration applying to View 1 will not apply to View 2. 

To navigate different views, we can select the target one in the view sidebar. By default, Grid View will be created for you after creating the table. You can create multiple views of a type, as long as they have unique View names.

## View Menu Bar

To work with `Views`, use View menu-bar on the right hand side - 
- <1> Toggle View menu-bar.
- <2> Displays created view-list for the selected table
  - Currently active view is high-lighted   
- <3> Add new view to the list

### Grid View

Grid View, as a default type of view, allows you to display your data in a spreadsheet-like interface.
